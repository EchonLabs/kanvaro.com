# Planning Sprint Events

## What This Is

Sprint events are structured meetings that facilitate agile development processes. This guide covers how to plan, prepare, and facilitate effective sprint events including retrospectives, sprint planning, sprint reviews, and daily standups using Kanvaro's sprint event management features.

## Basic Theory

Sprint events are time-boxed ceremonies in agile development that help teams:
- **Align on goals and progress**
- **Identify and resolve impediments**
- **Continuously improve processes**
- **Maintain team communication and collaboration**

### Types of Sprint Events

1. **Sprint Planning**: Define what will be accomplished in the upcoming sprint
2. **Daily Standup**: Brief daily check-ins to synchronize team progress
3. **Sprint Review**: Demonstrate completed work and gather feedback
4. **Sprint Retrospective**: Reflect on the sprint and identify improvements

## Prerequisites

- Active sprint with assigned tasks
- Team members with appropriate roles
- Kanvaro project with sprint events enabled
- Understanding of agile methodologies

## Step-by-Step Event Planning

### Step 1: Access Sprint Events

1. **Navigate to Sprint Events**: Go to the main navigation and select "Sprint Events"
2. **View Event List**: See all scheduled and completed sprint events
3. **Filter by Sprint**: Use filters to focus on specific sprints or event types

### Step 2: Create New Sprint Event

1. **Click "New Event"**: Located in the top-right corner of the sprint events page
2. **Select Event Type**: Choose from Planning, Review, Retrospective, or Standup
3. **Set Basic Details**:
   - **Title**: Descriptive event name (e.g., "Sprint 15 Planning")
   - **Sprint**: Select the associated sprint
   - **Date & Time**: Schedule the event
   - **Duration**: Set appropriate timebox (2-4 hours for planning, 15-30 min for standups)

### Step 3: Configure Event Details

1. **Add Description**: Provide context and objectives for the event
2. **Set Location**: Physical location or virtual meeting link
3. **Assign Facilitator**: Select team member responsible for leading the event
4. **Invite Attendees**: Add all team members who should participate
5. **Set Agenda**: For complex events, outline discussion topics

### Step 4: Prepare Event Materials

1. **Review Sprint Data**: Check current sprint progress and metrics
2. **Prepare Agenda**: Create structured agenda for planning and review events
3. **Gather Artifacts**: Prepare any documents, charts, or demos needed
4. **Set Up Environment**: Ensure meeting space or virtual tools are ready

## Event-Specific Planning

### Sprint Planning Events

**Objectives**: Define sprint goals and select tasks to complete

**Preparation Checklist**:
- [ ] Product backlog reviewed and prioritized
- [ ] Team capacity assessed
- [ ] Sprint goal defined
- [ ] High-priority items identified
- [ ] Dependencies mapped
- [ ] Acceptance criteria clarified

**Agenda Template**:
1. **Review Sprint Goal** (15 min)
2. **Capacity Planning** (15 min)
3. **Backlog Review** (30 min)
4. **Task Estimation** (45 min)
5. **Sprint Commitment** (15 min)

### Daily Standup Events

**Objectives**: Synchronize team progress and identify impediments

**Best Practices**:
- Keep each update to 1-2 minutes
- Focus on three key questions:
  - What did you accomplish yesterday?
  - What will you work on today?
  - Are there any impediments?
- Use timer to maintain timebox
- Note action items for follow-up

### Sprint Review Events

**Objectives**: Demonstrate completed work and gather feedback

**Preparation Checklist**:
- [ ] Completed items demonstrated
- [ ] Sprint goal achievement assessed
- [ ] Stakeholders invited
- [ ] Demo environment prepared
- [ ] Feedback collection method ready

**Agenda Template**:
1. **Sprint Overview** (5 min)
2. **Demo Completed Work** (20-30 min)
3. **Sprint Metrics Review** (10 min)
4. **Stakeholder Feedback** (15 min)
5. **Next Steps Discussion** (10 min)

### Sprint Retrospective Events

**Objectives**: Reflect on processes and identify improvements

**Preparation Checklist**:
- [ ] Sprint data and metrics prepared
- [ ] Retrospective format selected (e.g., Start/Stop/Continue, 4Ls)
- [ ] Safe environment established
- [ ] Action items from previous retrospectives reviewed

**Common Retrospective Formats**:
- **Start/Stop/Continue**: What to start, stop, or continue doing
- **4Ls**: Liked, Learned, Lacked, Longed for
- **Sailboat**: Wind in sails (what helped), anchors (what hindered)

## Facilitation Tips

### General Facilitation Guidelines

1. **Time Management**: Strictly adhere to timeboxes
2. **Active Participation**: Ensure all voices are heard
3. **Focus Maintenance**: Keep discussions on topic
4. **Action Items**: Document decisions and follow-up items
5. **Positive Environment**: Maintain constructive dialogue

### Virtual Event Considerations

- **Technical Setup**: Ensure reliable video/audio
- **Engagement Tools**: Use polls, reactions, and breakout rooms
- **Visual Aids**: Share screens effectively
- **Time Zone Awareness**: Schedule considering team locations

### Remote Team Challenges

- **Asynchronous Communication**: Use chat for extended discussions
- **Visual Collaboration**: Leverage digital whiteboards
- **Regular Check-ins**: More frequent than co-located teams
- **Technology Proficiency**: Ensure all tools work for participants

## Event Documentation

### Recording Outcomes

1. **Meeting Notes**: Capture key decisions and discussions
